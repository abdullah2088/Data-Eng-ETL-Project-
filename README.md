This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python in Google Colab.
The notebook covers the three main phases of ETL:

Extract – Reading data from different sources (CSV, APIs, or databases).

Transform – Cleaning, filtering, and transforming the extracted data into usable formats.

Load – Storing the processed data into a target system (such as a database, CSV, or cloud storage).

This project was created as a hands-on practice for understanding ETL concepts and data engineering workflows.

**⚙️ Features**

✔ Data extraction from source files
✔ Data cleaning and transformation (handling null values, formatting, filtering)
✔ Data loading into structured format
✔ Written in Python (Google Colab Notebook)
✔ Beginner-friendly and easy to extend
